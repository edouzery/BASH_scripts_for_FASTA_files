# BASH scripts for FASTA files

## fasta_DeleteSeq.sh

It deletes sequence(s) from an uniline FASTA file.

## Example ##

  `fasta_DeleteSeq.sh population_snp.fasta ;`
 
```js
  
xxx

```

## Problem detection ##

Each sequence should be written on a single line.

  `fasta_DeleteSeq.sh test.fas`
 
```
    Sorry ... Your FASTA file is not UNILINE !
```
