# BASH_scripts_for_FASTA_files

## fasta_Parser.sh

This BASH script checks the format of a FASTA file.
- Is it uniline (= each sequence written on a single line)? 
- Are sequences aligned?

If correct, it retruns the **number of sequences** and the **number of sites** (= columns of the alignment).
