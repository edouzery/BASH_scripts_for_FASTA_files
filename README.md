# BASH scripts for FASTA files

This repository contains BASH scripts to **extract information** and **sequences** from FASTA files.

## fasta_Distance.sh

Compute **distance** descriptive statistics on pairs of DNA sequences from a FASTA file : **number of sites** (constant, variable, gapped), **transitions**, **transversions**, and differences between **each pair** of nucleotide.

## fasta_Keep_Longest.sh

Extracts the **longest sequence** of a FASTA file.

## fasta_Length_Seq.sh

Computes the length of each sequence of a FASTA file and returns descriptive statistics (**mean**, **median**, **min**, **max**, **95% confidence interval** of all lengths).

## fasta_Parser.sh

Checks the format of a FASTA **alignment** file and returns the **number of sequences** and the **number of sites**.
